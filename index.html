<h1>My <mark>Motivation Factor</mark> towards <u>Online Education</u></h1>

<p>The dangerous <i>pandemic</i> that spread in Malaysia; <strong>Covid-19</strong>, is still free in it's surrounding. All workers, students and citizens cannot go outside if no important things to avoid this pandemic infected with easy. Now, <abbr title="Movement Control Order">MCO</abbr> was at the phase 4, which is start from 28 April 2020 untill 12 May 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Covid-19</strong> have changed my university life into <b>online education</b> that replaces a direct communication. Although, it was hard to be accepted at first but I feels this is my challenge to become a successful student. I keep reminds for my self that <q>A bright sunshine is behind the grey sky</q>. This motivation word I always remember when I had a trouble in my studies or in my life. After 4 weeks I study via online, I can adapt with the current situation with comfortable. The motivation factor which helps me in study via online is it can save money, time and effort. To elaborate more, <b>online education</b> allows me to study at house that can save my parents' money to send or fetch me from university. Moreover, my time is not wasted by walking to attend the class that needs a several minutes before I arrive in it. In addition, I can calmly wait while sit in front of my study desk for the class via online to start without use a big effort.</p>

<p>I also like to search some motivational quotes for students. The website name is Live Bold & Bloom. This is the one quote from Live Bold & Bloom that I admire.</p>
